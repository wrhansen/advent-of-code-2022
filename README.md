# What is this?

I'm just messing around and using the 2022 advent of code to learn a new language.
I'm thinking about getting more into go because it's always interested me.

To run any of these days, simply run the following:

```bash
$ go run advent5.go
```

# Notes

## advent5.go

This was my first start on the advent calendar this year and I did it in probably
the most backwards way possible. I didn't realize until I had written out all code
that the site would give you some input to parse and enter an answer into. I didn't feel like spending too much time on fixing my code so that it could read some input from a file, so I just used some multicursor editing in my text editor to create the necessary function calls that the input required.

I got both stars for the day, but if I feel like it I'll probably go back and fix this by adding some actual input parsing.
